The app includes a page to see price graphs for these coins as well as a page to see how much you, the user, has in his or her wallet. The web app also has a page to see the current list of all users (including expert users) and another page to see the 3 most recent "expert opinions" of the expert users . Consequently, the app also has a page exclusive to expert users that allows them to create posts of their opinions on the 3 coins featured in the app.
